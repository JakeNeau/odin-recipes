        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            You all saw that popular internet post that did the rounds a while ago. With this simple recipe, you don't even need any equipment.
            All that is required is a raw chicken, your bare hands, and the sheer amount of will required to cook it through the power of your
            own slapping.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One raw chicken</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Unwrap your chicken and lay on a clean, flat, sturdy surface</li>
            <li>Slap the chicken roughly 23,034 times or until cooked</li>
            <li>Alternatively, you may slap the chicken once at 1,666 meters per second if you prefer it well done</li>

        </ol>
